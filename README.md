## Work Experience
### Research & Working Experience
**UC Santa Barbara Visiting Scholar, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Santa Barbara, USA
Sept. 2023â€“now**
- Investigated low-bit optimization and quantized training techniques, integrating gradient quantization and LoRA
adaptation to push the boundary of memory-efficient LLM fine-tuning.
- Collaborated with the Amazon AGI team, contributed to the intersection of AI algorithm design and hardware-efficient
training, paving the way for scalable LLM fine-tuning methodologies.
- Published at NAACL 2024 (Spotlight Paper), demonstrating superior scalability compared to existing
parameter-efficient tuning approaches.
